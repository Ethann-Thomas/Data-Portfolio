👋 Hello, I’m Ethan Thomas.

💼 I'm a Data Analyst currently working in technology for the Financial Services industry.

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, modeling, and visualization. My work typically focuses on automation, descriptive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Power BI, Python, SQL, and any other ad hoc tools that are necessary to ensure project success.

🌱 I am currently focused on managing expense reporting for the business, while designing and implementing an ETL process to support a large-scale migration to a new platform.

💡 I enjoy being a leader and building communities in analytics & tech. I work on a committee to educate and provide events, resources, and a pipeline to data experts to upskill employees and foster a data-driven working community.

📝 I share my thoughts on Medium, especially on how to break into the analytics field and how to network effectively.
